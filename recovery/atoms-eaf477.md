- Collapse 
- Redundant 
- Atoms 
- Reduce 

atom to void  
atoms and void  
void the atom  
otherwise empty  
almost protoplasma  
more or less protoplasma  
if all then nothing  
avoid nil  
destroyer  
profound shapes  
eastern waterfront  
seawall  
destroy the seawall  
the entire waterfront is at risk   
swallow the rising seas  
inhale the sun  
intelligently deprecate  
neon cricket  
into the stream below  
patch of light  
iridescent green  
towards the fire  
Nail on the Head  
Red Sunrise  
explosive vegetation  
detach 
interpolate  
colossal cold  
colossal hole  
false nostalgia  
distend  
And Flux  
Few Birds  
Or Something  
Nostalgic Monkey
